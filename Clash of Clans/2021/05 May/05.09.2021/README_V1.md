# Clash of Clans session May 9th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 3 Sundays ago, and it got stronger 2 Sundays ago)

## Main village

I did some upgrades in the main village, mostly just wall upgrades, as I am saving up 4 million gold (2 weeks, or 2 sessions) so I can gear up an archer tower (my 2nd building to be geared up) my goal after this is to upgrade the geared up cannon to level 12, and upgrade a mortar to level 8, then gear it up, so that I meet a requirement for the builder base 2nd builder.

Today, I didn't do any major upgrades, I spent over 2.5 million elixir on upgrading 5 walls to level 10, and I didn't spend sny gold today.

See last weeks status post about my decade project of getting all walls to level 9

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I received some good rewards, but I didn't want to upgrade the mega tesla next week and not be able to gear up my archer tower, so today, I spent 2.1 million gold upgrading one of my hidden teslas to level 7. I also began upgrading my cannon cart to level 14 for 2.6 million elixir.

I used the clock tower boost a bit late today, and enjoyed battling. I did my usual 6 battles today.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today, but for my final attacks, I tried out the skeleton balloon. It wasn't too helpful, likely because I need a better strategy, and because it is too low level.

## Overview

See above.
