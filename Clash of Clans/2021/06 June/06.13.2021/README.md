# Clash of Clans session June 13th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 8 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 7 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 4 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I did not get attacked since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my last level 6 wizard tower to level 7 for 2.2 million gold, and also upgrading 4 walls to level 9 for 500,000 elixir each (2 million elixir total) finally, I upgraded my Archer Queen to level 18 for 36000 dark elixir.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did well and was able to do some battles. I began upgrading my battle machine to level 16 for 2.6 million elixir. I didn't have enough to upgrade my Mega Tesla to level 4 today.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies.

## Overview

See above.
