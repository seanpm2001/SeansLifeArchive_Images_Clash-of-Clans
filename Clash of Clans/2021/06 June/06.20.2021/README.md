# Clash of Clans session June 20th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 9 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 8 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 5 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I did not get attacked since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a few walls to level 9, and upgrading an archer tower to level 12 for 2.5 million gold. I chose this upgrade over upgrading another air defense to level 8, although I will get to that goal eventually. I want to get all my archer towers to level 12.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did somewhat poorly well and was able to do some battles. I began upgrading a mega mine to level 5 for 120000 coins, as I needed to do some upgrade. I also cleaned up most of the night village and waited the clock tower boost out.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, although the recent update may have possibly changed the meta, as I did very poorly today.

## Overview

See above.
