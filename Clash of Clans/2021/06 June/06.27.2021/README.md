# Clash of Clans session June 27th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 10 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 9 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 6 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I got attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a few walls to level 9, and upgrading an air defense to level 7, as todays successful attack against me made me notice a weak spot in my base for ground troops, and I feel that I need to be more prepared for air attacks first, as they are more common.

I upgraded an air defense to level 7 for 2.0 million gold, and 3 walls to level 9 for 0.5 million elixir each, 1.5 million elixir total. There is still so much to upgrade.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did somewhat poorly well and was able to do some battles. I began upgrading a mega mine to level 6 for 300000 coins, as I needed to upgrade something. I did not clean up my base, and I waited the clock tower boost out.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did really well when I got going, my first 3 wins resulting in 100% destruction of the enemy base.

## Overview

See above.
