# Clash of Clans session July 4th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 11 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 10 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 7 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I did not get attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my 4th and final air defense to level 7 for 2 million coins, my spell factory to level 5 for 2.4 million elixir, and my barbarian king to level 45 for 45000 dark elixir. I did not upgrade any walls today, there is still so much to upgrade.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did somewhat poorly well and was able to do some battles. I decided to upgrade my last gold storage to level 9 instead of upgrading my mega tesla. I also cleaned up obstacles, surpassing 1000 total gems. I also upgraded 1 wall to level 4. I feel like wall upgrades will be difficult here as well.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did poorly today, and it took longer to get 6 wins.

## Overview

See above.
