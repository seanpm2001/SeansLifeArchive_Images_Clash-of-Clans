# Clash of Clans session July 11th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 12 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 11 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 8 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I got attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading an archer tower to level 12 for 2.5 million gold in one of the notable weak spots in my base, and also upgraded 5 walls to level 10 in the same area, making it less weak, and costing 2.5 million elixir. I got attacked since I last played, but the person wasn't trying very hard/didn't try, as they only got 2% and I didn't lose any resources. Those were all the upgrades I could afford here today.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did somewhat poorly well and was able to do some battles. I decided to upgrade one of my elixir storages to max level 9 for 2.5 million gold, instead of upgrading my mega tesla. I plan on maxing out the second elixir storage as well before I go back to maxing out my battle machine. I also cleaned up obstacles, surpassing 1060 total gems.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did somewhat poorly today, and it took a little while to get 6 wins.

## Overview

See above.
