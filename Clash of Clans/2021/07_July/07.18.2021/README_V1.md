# Clash of Clans session July 18th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 12 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 9 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I got attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a second mortar to level 7, and upgrading 6 walls to level 10. My base is really starting to become advanced. I did an actual attack today, for some reason I went with the first one available, and it seemed really unfair, as it was a level 49 with level 6 walls vs a level 120 with level 10 and level 11 walls (wall level indicates that I put a lot of time into my base) there is very little chance that they can attack me back successfully.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did pretty well and was able to do some battles. I decided to upgrade my battle machine to level 17 for 2.7 million elixir and clear up obstacles. I did not upgrade my Mega Tesla today, maybe next week I will do it, but I still need to upgrade so many things, including my elixir storage to level 9. I am working on making both my bases stronger against air attacks, but the upgrades cost too much on the main base, and seem inconvenient on the builder base.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did better today today, and it took a little less time to get 6 wins.

## Overview

See above.
