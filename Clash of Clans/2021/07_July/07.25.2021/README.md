# Clash of Clans session July 25th 2021

I had a very long session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I got attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a second mortar to level 7, and upgrading 2 walls to level 10. I didn't have very many resources today, as I got attacked badly since I last played, and the attacker retreated before destroying the last structure. I had to do 2 attacks today using all dragons. I didn't do very well, and I made a decent amount of money. I accidentally wasted gems on training a dragon, as I was clicking/tapping too fast. Most of my elixir went to training dragons. It felt bad only being able to upgrade a 3rd mortar to level 7 from all of this, there is still so much to upgrade. I also collected 1 gem box (25 gems) from the main village today.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did pretty well and was able to do some battles. I decided to upgrade my mega tesla to level 4 for 3.3 million coins. I forgot to use the clock tower boost early on, so I extended my session and did attacks in the main base, plus other tasks while I waited the boost out and harvested extra resources. I cleaned up obstacles in the builder base today as well.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did better today, and it took a little less time to get 6 wins. I did some experimental attacks with different troop combinations, but didn't do too well, so I went back to night witch spamming.

## Overview

See above.
