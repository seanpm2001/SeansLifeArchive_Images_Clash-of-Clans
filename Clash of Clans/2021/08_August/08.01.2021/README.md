# Clash of Clans session August 1st 2021

I had a shorter session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) I got attacked once since I last played. !-->

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a final mortar to level 7, and upgrading my laboratory to level 8, upgrading a seeking air mine to level 2, and upgrading my archer queen to level 19.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did worse and was able to do some battles. I decided to upgrade my push trap to level 9 for 300,000 gold, so I can save some gold to upgrade something else next week or later.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did worse today, and it took a bit more time to get 6 wins. I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts.

## Overview

See above.
