# Clash of Clans session August 15th 2021

I had a longer session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I got attacked once since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a spring trap to level 5 for 1.5 million coins, as I couldn't afford anything else due to the attack recently. I also went and upgraded 7 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each (500,000 gold each for 2 of them) 2.5 million elixir amd 1.0 million gold total. I got attacked once since I last played.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did worse and was able to do some battles. After getting 6 wins, I was still slightly short, and had to spend 34 gems to afford the last tiny bit of gold to upgrade my mega tesla to level 5.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did worse today, and it took a bit more time to get 6 wins. I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts. I dropped far below 2900 and 2800 trophies today due to these losses.

## Overview

See above.
