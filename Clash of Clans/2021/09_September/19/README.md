# Clash of Clans session 2021 September 19th

I had a longer session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I got many times since I last played, and didn't have enough gold to make a worthwhile upgrade.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a skeleton trap to level 3 for 1.2 million gold, and upgrading 2 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each, 1 million elixir total. I didn't have enough resources to do anything worthwhile today, as I got attacked at least 7 times since I last played, and lost millions of gold and elixir.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did a lot better and was able to do some battles. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my battle machine to level 20 for 3.2 million elixir, and waited out the last 11+ minutes of the boost. I cleaned up most common obstacles before doing battles.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did a lot better today, and it took a lot less time to get 6 wins. I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts. I dropped far below 2900 and 2800 trophies today due to these losses. - 2021 September 12th
