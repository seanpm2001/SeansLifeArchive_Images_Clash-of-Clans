# Clash of Clans session 2021 October 3rd

I had a longer session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 versus battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I did not get attacked since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a cannon to level 12 for 2,000,000 gold. I hope to gear up my mortar once ready, but it costs 8 million gold, and that is going to take a long time to save up for. I am going to try and buy every major gold upgrade that costs between 2 million and 3.4 million before I attempt to gear it up, as once I gear it up, I can meet one of the 4 requirements for getting the 2nd builder on the builder base (one of the 4 requirements is to gear up 3 buildings on the main base) I also upgraded 6 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each, 3 million elixir total.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my mega tesla to level 7 for 3.8 million gold, then I went and waited out the last 14+ minutes of the boost. I cleaned up most common obstacles before doing battles.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did a lot better today, and it took a lot less time to get 6 wins. I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts. I dropped far below 2900 and 2800 trophies today due to these losses. - 2021 September 12th
