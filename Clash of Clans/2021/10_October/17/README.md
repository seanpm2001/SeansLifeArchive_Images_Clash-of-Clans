# Clash of Clans session 2021 October 17th

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 versus battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I did not get attacked since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my archer queen to level 20 for 40000 dark elixir, upgrading my last cannon to level 12 for 2 million gold, and upgrading sedveral walls to level 10 for 500,000 coins/500,000 elixir each.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I didn't do any upgrades today and waited around for the last 6 minutes of the clock tower boost to go away.

### Battles

I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts. I dropped far below 2900 and 2800 trophies today due to these losses. - 2021 September 12th
