# Clash of Clans session 2021 October 24th

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 versus battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I did not get attacked since I last played.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my 2nd bomb tower to level 3 for 2.5 million gold, and upgrading 4 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,000,000 elixir total. I am surprised how I have managed to get almost half of my walls from level 9 to level 10 already.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my builder barracks to level 11 for 2,000,000 elixir. It will unlock the hog glider, which I may try out. I just wanted to do an upgrade today. Next week, I will be upgrading my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold.
