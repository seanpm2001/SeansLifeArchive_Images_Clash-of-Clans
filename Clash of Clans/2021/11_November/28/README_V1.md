# Clash of Clans session 2021 November 28th

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 versus battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> I didn't get attacked since I last played.

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my 2nd bomb tower to level 3 for 2.5 million gold, and upgrading 4 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,000,000 elixir total. I am surprised how I have managed to get almost half of my walls from level 9 to level 10 already. - 2021 Sunday October 24th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my hidden tesla to level 7 for 2 million gold, and upgrading 4 walls to level 10 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,000,000 elixir total.

## Builder base

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my builder barracks to level 11 for 2,000,000 elixir. It will unlock the hog glider, which I may try out. I just wanted to do an upgrade today. Next week, I will be upgrading my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 24th

Today in the builder base, I did really well, getting 3 3 star attacks in a row, but after that, it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 31st

Today in the builder base, I did well, taking me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my elixir to level 9 for 2.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday November 7th

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my battle machine to level 22 for 3.2 million elixir. I am just upgrading it to see if it can get at all better, and so I can unlock O.T.T.O. I have come to the conclusion that the Battle Machine is the worst hero in the game, as it always goes out of its way to kill itself, either going directly to a crusher, or walking through 6 buildings and getting shot 200 times, then dying without hitting anything. It still is decent in some ways (it is better than nothing) but I still consider it the worst hero to have. - 2021 Sunday November 14th

Today in the builder base, I did well, and it didn't take very long to get 6 wins, as I had multiple trophy droppers go against me in a row. Whenever I see a completely maxed out base, I assume that it is someone dropping down. This hasn't failed me yet. Whenever I try it, it never works, but when others do, it does. Last tim I tried to just deploy the battle machine and surrender, it ended in a draw. I don't get it. Once I was done with battles, I upgraded a hidden mine to level 9 for 500,000 gold. - 2021 Sunday November 21st

Today in the builder base, I did well, and it took a little while to get to 6 wins. On one attack, I managed to destroy a nearly maxed out base. I upgraded a hidden mine to level 9 for 500,000 gold again before quitting, with 2 left after this one. - 2021 Sunday November 28th

### 3D Touch issues

While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021 November 28th
