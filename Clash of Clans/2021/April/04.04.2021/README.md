# Clash of Clans session April 4th 2021

I had a normal length Clash of Clans session today

## Main village

I didn't do much on the main village today. I did collection, started upgrading my Golem, upgraded several walls, and began upgrading a 2nd wizard tower to level 7. Apparently, everything is half off for a week, it is disappointing that everything will go back to full price next week

## Builder base

I spent some time in the builder base today and got my 6 successful attacks. I began upgrading my star laboratory to level 9, and I copied an opponents stone path to the boat dock idea, and made my own modified version.

## Overall

I had a good time, and made decent progress.
