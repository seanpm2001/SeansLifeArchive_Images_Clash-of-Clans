# Clash of Clans session April 11th 2021

I had a usual length Clash of Clans session, starting my clocktower boost late, and running it out; doing some upgrades, and doing my 6 daily Builder Base battles.

## Home village

I didn't spend very much time in the home village again, as I prefer the builder base's gameplay mechanics most of the time

### Cleaning

I cleaned up 1 Gem box today and earned 25 gems. I have so many holiday decorations from the past 6-8 years that there is no room for many obstacles to form, so I am lucky for it to form a gem box every 1-3 weeks (and nothing else, as there is no room)

### Upgrades

Upgrades currently are half off in celebration of a new update coming soon. I didn't realize until today that walls were half off as well, and I only upgraded 2 walls here today.

The 3 main upgrades I did today was upgrading an archer tower to level 12, something I could have only dreamed of back in 2010-2013, I also upgraded my dark spell factory to max level 5, which won't even be finished by next weeks session, and I upgraded a spring trap to level 5.

## Builder base

I did my usual Builder Base gameplay today, but started the clock tower a bit late. I got my 6 weekly wins.

### Cleaning

I cleaned up many obstacles today and earned some xp and gems.

### Upgrades

I upgraded 2 walls to level 4 or 5, and began upgrading my gold mine to level 9, the last gold mine upgrade until the next Builder Base builder hall update.

## Overview

See above.
