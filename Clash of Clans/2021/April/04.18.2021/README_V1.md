# Clash of Clans session April 18th 2021

I had a normal length session today. The game finally got an update, and building upgrades went back to normal price, although it seems like some are now just lower.

## Main village

I did some upgrades in the main village, beginning an upgrade on a wizard tower to level 7, and upgrading several walls. Soon, I will have all level 9 or higher walls. Although, it seems impossible to truly max out your base as a free to play, especially when you only play once a week, and don't do battles. I unfortunately spent money on this game in the past on my iOS account (which I no longer have, as of 2015. I spent at least $40 on it) I spent about $20 on this village, but stopped doing in-app purchases, as they are not worth it, and I no longer make them. I am mentioning this, because I am a Town Hall 10 and my base isn't maxed out after over 7 years, and Town Hall 14 was just released in the past week.

## Builder base

I made some progress on the builder base today. I am saving up to unlock upgrades to unlock O.T.T.O and today, I upgraded a cannon cart, and I began upgrading my elixir collector to max level, as I still have 2 that needed to be maxed out, and I didn't want to spend too much gold, as I am saving up to get the Mega Tesla to the correct level.

### Battles

Today, I didn't just do night witch spam like I normally do. I tried a few different attack strategies, but they didn't come close to the successfulness of the night witch attacks, so I went back to night witch spamming after a bit. I likely need to upgrade the troops before trying again. I didn't try any strategies with raged barbarians, sneaky archers, or cannon carts though.

## Overview

See above.
