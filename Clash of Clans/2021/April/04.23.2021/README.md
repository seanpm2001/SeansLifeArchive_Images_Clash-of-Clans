# April 23rd 2021 - Didn't play

I didn't play Clash of Clans today. I took a break from it, as I didn't have the time. I wanted to play today, but I didn't have the time.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, October 24th 2020 about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Sunday. I will be playing again on Sunday, April 25th 2021.
