# Clash of Clans March 28th 2021 session

I had a good time playing Clash of Clans today.

## Main village

In the main village today, I upgraded 2 walls to level 9 with `250000` elixir and `250000` gold. I also began construction on a 3rd x-bow (2,000,000 gold) and began to upgrade my 3rd dark elixir drill to level 4. I got a gem box today. I have so many decorations now from all the various seasons and events, that I can only get 1 new removable object every 1-2 weeks (every time it has been a gembox) I chose the X-BOw over upgrading my last level 10 archer tower to level 11.

I don't do attacks anymore at the moment, as I prefer the builder base.

## Builder base

Today, I managed to get my 6 daily wins. I came across 3 bases that featured a Nazi Swastika (its impossible to get the good swastika that isn't turned 45 degrees, due to the layout of the game) these bases shouldn't be a thing.

Today, I upgraded a wall to level 5 for `800000` gold, and didn't do any other upgrades, although I cleaned up most obstacles before battle. I am trying to save up for the level 9 star laboratory so I can get closer to unlocking O.T.T.O. I was about `250000` elixir off from upgrading the star laboratory today, so I upgraded a random elixir collector instead. I originally considered upgrading some traps, then decided not to do that.

## Summary

### New buildings

* X-Bow #3 level 1

* Elixir Collector level 9

### Cleanup

* Cleaned most obstacles from the builder base (except for irreplacable obstacles, such as stone, tree groves, etc.)

* Cleaned up 1 Gen box from the main village and got `6` XP, and `25` gems
