# Clash of Clans session 2022, Sunday, October 16th

I had a long length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 versus battles. <!-- Taken out on August 1st 2021, this is getting too old || I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 14 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 13 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 10 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it) !--> <!--I didn't get attacked since I last played.!--> I did not get attacked since I last played.

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some walls to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began to build a second inferno tower. I am now capable of upgrading to town hall 11, but may possibly not do so, as I am already really low on space, and I also heard about a 100 building limit. There was 1 new gembox today.

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (4) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began upgrading my level 8 mortar to a multi-mortar for 8 million gold. I became really bummed out, as I spent 1246 gems to get the remaining gold for the upgrade. Despite the fact that the gems won't get spent on anything if this doesn't happen, it is still hard to lose 1000 gems, especially as a free to play. The upgrade will complete in 2 weeks. I spent nearly half an hour or longer collecting from gold mines and elixir collectors, so that I would have some resources stocked up further in the base. It was pretty pointless, but I used to enjoy doing this a long time ago from time to time. The game had to be updates today. Also, I accidentally deleted screenshots 51 to 100 before the transfer, they no longer exist, and I am very disappointed in myself. - 2022 May 8th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (5) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began upgrading a skeleton trap to max level 4 for 1.5 million gold. My mult-mortar still has over 168 hours left, so next Sunday (due to my recent schedule shift) I am going to have to remember to wait an extra hour before playing. The upgrade is about halfway done. - 2022 May 15th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (at least 7) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and for 2 walls 500,000 gold each, and began upgrading a second mortar to level 8 for 3.0 million gold. My mult-mortar still had a little over half an hour left upon resuming, so I went and did things in the builder base, and waited for the countdown. After the upgrade finished, I was able to upgrade O.T.T.O to level 2, which I originally thought could only be done once all the objectives were reached. The upgrade did nothing.

I earned an achievement for gearing up 3 buildings, and was able to level up to level 126. There were no gemboxes today. - 2022 May 22nd

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a single wall to level 11 for 500,000 gold, and began upgrading my barbarian king to level 28 for 51000 dark elixir, my last skeleton trap to max level 4 for 1.5 million gold, and a second barracks to level 12 for 2.5 million elixir.

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a hidden tesla to level 8 for 2.5 million gold, and a third barracks to level 12 for 2.5 million elixir. There was 1 gembox today, I discovered it much earlier on. Today, I didn't do any wall upgrades, I should get back to these after I upgrade the 4th barracks to level 12. To afford the upgrade today, I had to take some troops out of my barracks queue. I did this after starting the upgrade as well, so I would have extra resources next week, in case I don't remember the barracks queue. I stayed around for a long time after doing my versus battles, collection is fun, and it was just relaxing leisure gameplay. - 2022, Sunday, June 5th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading 2 spring traps to max level 4 for 1.2 million gold each, 2.4 million gold total, and a fourth and final barracks to level 12 for 2.5 million elixir. I should get back to wall upgrades next week. Today, I wanted to upgrade another hidden tesla to level 8, but I couldn't afford it, and I intend to not spend my gems. There weren't any gemboxes today. Today, I didn't do any wall upgrades. I also toured a max level base to see what things are like, I don't like the look of TH14 very much - 2022, Sunday, June 12th

### Home village battles

<!-- No data available for home village battles at the moment, new section. - 2022, Sunday, May 29th !-->

I did not start any battles in the home village, or get attacked by anyone since I last played. - 2022, Sunday, May 29th to 2022, Sunday, October 16th

I feel like I am not visible to other players for attacks at all anymore.

## Builder base

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my builder barracks to level 11 for 2,000,000 elixir. It will unlock the hog glider, which I may try out. I just wanted to do an upgrade today. Next week, I will be upgrading my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 24th

Today in the builder base, I did really well, getting 3 3 star attacks in a row, but after that, it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 31st

Today in the builder base, I did well, taking me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my elixir to level 9 for 2.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday November 7th

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my battle machine to level 22 for 3.2 million elixir. I am just upgrading it to see if it can get at all better, and so I can unlock O.T.T.O. I have come to the conclusion that the Battle Machine is the worst hero in the game, as it always goes out of its way to kill itself, either going directly to a crusher, or walking through 6 buildings and getting shot 200 times, then dying without hitting anything. It still is decent in some ways (it is better than nothing) but I still consider it the worst hero to have. - 2021 Sunday November 14th

Today in the builder base, I did well, and it didn't take very long to get 6 wins, as I had multiple trophy droppers go against me in a row. Whenever I see a completely maxed out base, I assume that it is someone dropping down. This hasn't failed me yet. Whenever I try it, it never works, but when others do, it does. Last tim I tried to just deploy the battle machine and surrender, it ended in a draw. I don't get it. Once I was done with battles, I upgraded a hidden mine to level 9 for 500,000 gold. - 2021 Sunday November 21st

Today in the builder base, I did well, and it took less time to get to 6 wins.

There was 1 battle that I lost where I had a single bat left, untargeted by any defenses. I did the community a favor and didn't wait for the bat to get killed or run out of time, I just promptly ended the battle. I wouldn't have won anyways (as of ending the battle, we both had the same percentage, but my opponent had a second star). I suggest anyone who does strategies like "sneaky archers" or runs into a situation where it takes more than 10 seconds to destroy a single building to just end the battle. Don't waste peoples time. - 2022, Sunday, March 27th

## 3D Touch issues

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021, Sunday, November 28th

## Clan capital

So last week (2022, Sunday, May 8th) Clash of Clans had an update I forgot to mention until now (2022, Sunday, May 15th, but I didn't write about it until 2022, Wednesday, May 18th) the clan capital seems to be a new gamemode, but since my clan is and always will be inactive, there is no way I can get the clan to level 2 to unlock this region. I did not visit the clan capital today. - 2022, Sunday, May 15th

## ProtonDrive comments

ProtonDrive recently began acting up, and is stalling on large uploads 100 megabytes or larger. I had to split the image inodes into groups of 50 compared to the normal groups of 100, and didn't correct this, as I felt like changing it up. - 2022 Sunday, May 8th

I am still using this system. - 2022, Sunday, May 15th to 2022, Sunday, May 22nd

## GitHub

I am no longer uploading data for this project to GitHub, as I dropped support for Git-image part B work due to ongoing issues.

This decision was revered on 2022, Wednesday, October 12th, and I am uploading data again. I can only catch up on data from my XPS 13 laptop at the moment, as my main laptop is coming back from repairs.

## Overview
