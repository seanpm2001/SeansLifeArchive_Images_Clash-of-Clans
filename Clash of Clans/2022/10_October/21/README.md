# 2022 October 21st - Didn't play

I didn't play Clash of Clans today. I took a break from it, as I didn't have the time. I wanted to play today, but I didn't have the time.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on 2020 Saturday, October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Sunday. I will be playing again on 2022 Sunday, October 23rd.

## Upload notice

Starting with a decision on 2022, Thursday, July 21st, I will no longer be uploading Git-image part A files to GitHub on a daily/weekly basis. I am making a transition. Images from 2022 July 24th and onward will not be uploaded here. This decision was reversed on 2022, Wednesday, October 12th
