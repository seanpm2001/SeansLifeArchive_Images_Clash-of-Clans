# Clash of Clans Experience

Clash of Clans has been a consistent game for me for most of my childhood and early adult life. I started playing it in Elementary School, and have gone through ~3 different main accounts (~2 on iOS 6 and 1 on Android)

I have unfortunately spent money on the game in the past, but not very much. I have never spent a single penny on the builder base.

## iOS

My Clash of Clans experience on iOS started around 2012 and ended in 2015, when my last iPod had its charging port fail 100% and the device never turned back on. I was a mostly rushed Town Hall 10.

My first Clash of Clans clan was titled `The turkey clan` I never made it to 2000 trophies on this account, and this was far before the Builder Base update arrived.

This account consumed $60.00 over the course of 3 years, and I am not proud of it.

## Android

My Clash of Clans experience resumed on Android in 2014, as I had access to Android a year before I stopped using iOS. I commonly used alt accounts, including on BlueStacks. I no longer have access to any of my alt accounts. Some have even been hijacked.

This account consumed $20.00 in its first 2 years, and I am not proud of it. I didn't go past town hall 10 with monetary support, and I have been a free-to-play since 2018. I know that I likely will not become a maxed town hall 11 or higher, and that I may not max out the builder base.

I stopped playing in 2018, but resumed in 2020. Although outdated, I do not plan to leave the `clashoftrm` clan, or change my username from the `seantrm` handle, although these are both obsolete.

I stopped doing player attacks in 2021, and focused mainly on the builder base, with continuous upgrades in the main village.

In the first half of 2022, I made the achievement of getting all my walls to level 10 or higher.
