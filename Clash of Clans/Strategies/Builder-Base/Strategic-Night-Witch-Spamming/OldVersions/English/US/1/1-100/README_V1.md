# My 2022 night witch strategy

This document goes over my main Clash of Clans strategy (an effective and strategic night witch spamming strategy)

## Air superiority

With my night witch attacks, air superiority is the key goal. Once air superiority is achieved, I can quickly 3 star any base.

**Primary key targets:** Scorcher, air bombs

Once these are taken out, the road to air superiority is quick

**Secondary key targets:** Multi-mortar, Lava launcher, Giant cannon

These 3 are the most dangerous to groups of night witches, and should be taken out as quickly as possible

**Tertiary key targets:** Double cannons, Cannons, crushers (not entirely required for air superiority)

These 2 should be avoided, as they can kill 1 night witch every 4.5-6 seconds. Try to get the battle machine or the bats to take them out before they get in range.

**Quaternary key targets:** archer tower, firecrackers, guard post, hidden tesla

These are not as much of a concern, but need to be taken out to achieve air superiority

**Quinary key targets:** Mega tesla

The mega tesla is normally easy to take out, but should be avoided by night witches directly. Use bats or battle machines to take these out.

**Senary key targets:** Hidden bombs, giant bombs, hidden air bombs, push traps, spring traps

These typically can't be planned for, as you never know where they are, but you can partially defend against some of them by letting the battle machine go first, and soak up damage. Push traps however, are not a concern to me (except if they fling troops right into a crusher) sometimes, the pushtraps move the nightwitches AWAY from danger, and let them spawn additional bats before going back into the combat zone.

## Buffers

In the case that an attack doesn't go well, a safeguard is to destroy as many buildings as possible to get a high enough percentage. Sometimes, even a single army camp can decide if a battle is won or lost.

**Primary buffer targets:** army camps, barracks, elixir collectors, gold mines, gem mines, battle machine homepad, builder hut

These are quick and easy to destroy.

**Secondary buffer targets:** gold storages, elixir storages

These don't attack troops either, but are harder to destroy, due to much higher levels of hitpoints.

## Core

Core targets are a secondary goal for every battle.

**Primary core target:** Builder hall

Of course I want to go for the builder hall. It is the key target in every battle, as it is either the first, second, or third star, and can give a significant advantage in winning battles.
