Included here is the SUPERCELL Fan Content Policy. I am keeping this document here as a reference, as the website may be altered/unavailable in the future. Unfortunately, the Internet Archives Wayback Machine may not be a viable option to display this document either, due to unethical lawsuits made against the Internet Archieve.

## [Former violations](#Former-violations)

- ยง1: **No domains or the like**

> The domain [`Seanpm2001-SUPERCELL`](https://github.com/seanpm2001-SUPERCELL/) was created in the past without knowing this rule. However, since 2022 August 16th, this domain is deleted (due to my 2022 GitHub Organization purge) if it happens to be recreated, please know that I am not operating the domain.

> **Note:** _I created the repositories [:octocat: `SUPERCELL`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SUPERCELL/) and [:octocat: `Seanpm2001-SUPERCELL`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-SUPERCELL/) on 2023, Saturday, September 2nd. After reading the content policy, I decided to make these 2 repositories, with a main purpose of informing users about this information, and to serve as a hub of information on the former domains. These repositories are not considered domains, so it is in compliance with the SUPERCELL Fan Content Policy._
