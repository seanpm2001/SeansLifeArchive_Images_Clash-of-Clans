Even a Barbarian would understand that a lot of players just want to use the Supercell Assets (see below) to create cool stuff around the games. We&apos;re really, really excited about that. However, at times people go too far and try to convince the community that their products, services, sites or videos are connected with, endorsed or produced by Supercell. There are people out there who do this deliberately in order to take advantage of the Community and the efforts of the Supercell game teams. This can lead to players believing in information, buying stuff or even providing personal data on the basis of that content being official. This makes us very unhappy.</span></p><p class="para2"><span class="span2">This Fan Content Policy governs your use of Supercell Oy&apos;s (&quot;Supercell&quot;) copyrights and trademarks from our games, including any related fan kits provided by us (&quot;Supercell Assets&quot;) for Fan Content purposes.
