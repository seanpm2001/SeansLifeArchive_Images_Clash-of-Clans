# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Clash-of-Clans
The module for my life story project that contains my Clash of Clans gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly Clash of Clans session pictures. I currently play the [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&hl=en_US&gl=US)

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Clash of Clans all the way back in 2011/2012. I used to play the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clash-of-clans/id529479190).

I started playing the game again several times, from 2012 to 2014, then again in 2015 to 2018, then again in 2020.
